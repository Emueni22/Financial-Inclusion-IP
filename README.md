# Financial-Inclusion-IP
This repository applies Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to find out the major demographic factors affecting Financial inclusion in East Africa. Case of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania.

## Problem Statement
Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account, showing that a majority of the population does not have access to a lot of financial services which can greatly impact their financial outcomes.

The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account and provide insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.
